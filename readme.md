# Technologies Used
- In our project, we used two python libraries: Tkinter and pymysql. Tkinter is a built-in GUI that comes with python, and it supports the buttons/text fields used in our project. pymysql is a library for python that allows us to connect to a running MySQL server, and allows us to access the database, views, and procedures.
